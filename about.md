  Hey there! 
  My name is Anh. I'm currently in Bielefeld, the city located in Germany which - according to urban legends - never exists :smile:.
  About 30, an age old enough to have some experiences and expertices and young enough to still be ambitious and highly motivated and "trÃ¤umerisch"
  I'm a consultant 30 at age. Started as a software developer, --> finance--> serialization and pharmaceutical...--> but my heart remains nerdy.
  I started this blog one night, tired of hosting, database backup, CMS update, SEO and so on. 
  It should be something lightweight, simple, can't be that hard right? 
  At the end the sake of the blog was just to share a piece of my mind with you.
  And well, I wanted to mess with markdown abit :smile:. 
  It's awesome, I tell you. Easy, readable, gets the job done, that's all.

  So with that introduction, don't expect breaking news, huge inspirations or else you will be dissapointed. 
  Instead you can count on little nerdy things like code, DIY side projects to try out at home and other entertainments for techies.

  Thanks for all the supports and positive feedbacks til now. Big hug and I hope that we could continue this road together for a long time.

  Cheers,
  Anh
