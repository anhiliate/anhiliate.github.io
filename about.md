Hey there! 

My name is Anh. I'm currently in Bielefeld, the city located in Germany which - according to urban legends - never exists :smile:.
I'm a consultant 30 at age. Started as a software developer with a strong focus on financial services, I then dove into serialization and national medical verification systems.
Unchanged remains my nerdiness.

I started this blog one night, tired of setups, hosting, database backup, CMS update, SEO and so on. 
It should be something lightweight and simple. 
At the end the sake of the blog was just to share a piece of mind with you, can't be that hard right? 
And well, I wanted to mess with markdown abit :smile:. 
(It's awesome, I tell you. Easy, readable, gets the job done, that's all I have to say)

So with that introduction, don't expect breaking news, huge inspirations from this blog or else you will be dissapointed. 
Instead you can count on little geeky things like code, DIY side projects to try out at home and other entertainments for techies.

Thanks for all the supports and positive feedbacks til now. 
Big hug and I hope that we could continue this road together for a long time.

Thanks for reading! Cheers,
Anh
